<center><img src="./src/title.png" width="220" height="170" align-center /></center>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Project
A Financial education app created by a team of 3 college kids as part of the Human Computer Interaction 2520 course at the University of Iowa. This app was created to help people learn about financial literacy at their own pace. Many other competitors were analyzed and we found that they were either too complicated or too simple. We wanted to create an app that was simple enough for anyone to use, but also had enough information to be useful.
## Setup Instructions

As of right now, the app is not hosted anywhere. To run the app, you will need to clone the repository and run it locally.

Your computer will need to have Node.js installed. You can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After cloning the repository, you will need to install the dependencies. To do this, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then run the following command:

### `npm install`

This will install all of the dependencies needed to run the app.

### Running the App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
